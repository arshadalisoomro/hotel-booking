# Booking Project #

### Description ###

Spring MVC Web application that simulates a hotel booking system.

It allows the users to check the available hotels, search for not booked rooms given a time frame, leave feedback about the hotels and some fancy more features.

This implementation uses Spring Security to manage all the permissions and roles.

This project was developed for IADI's (Internet Applications Design and Implementation) course at FCT-UNL, 2015.
